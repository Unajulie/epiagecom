				<description><![CDATA[Different species have different lifespans. For example, a dwarf goby fish (Eviota sigillata) lives only eight weeks, the Greenland shark lives in contrast for 400 years. Forest shrew lives about two years, and bowhead whales up to 200 years. The average life expectancy of a person today is 79 years, although, some people live much [&#8230;]]]></description>

Therefore, this information can help an individual make proper, healthy lifestyle choices that may halt the aging process [&#8230;]]]></description>

Sweet breath, for example, could be a sign of diabetes. Twenty-four centuries later, Israeli scientists have learned not only to diagnose diseases from the air exhaled by patients, but also to predict disease development at early [&#8230;]]]></description>

Epigenetics has a tremendous potential for resetting the changes in aging through partial genetic reprogramming, which is a remodeling of epigenetic marks (DNA methylation).

				<description><![CDATA[Scientists discovered an almost complete skull of the Australopithecus anamensis, who lived 3.8 million years ago in Northeast Ethiopia. Thanks to this finding, the experts established that Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus anamensis, lived simultaneously at least 100 thousand years. The analysis of this discovery casts doubt on the notions that were deeply ingrained in the [&#8230;]]]></description>

The study goal was to examine whether it is possible to regenerate the thymus and fortify the immune system, which tends to deteriorate as we age. The medicinal cocktail contained &#8211; growth hormone as well as two anti-diabetic [&#8230;]]]></description>
